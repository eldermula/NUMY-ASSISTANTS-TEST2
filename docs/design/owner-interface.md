# Owner Interaction Interface (Workspace + Assistant)

## Concept
Secure web workspace with assistant panel and auditable actions.

## Structure
- Top bar: org selector, search/command, profile
- Left dock: Tasks, Pages, Files, Admin, Reports
- Main area: tabs (preferred) or windows
- Assistant: right panel + activity log

## Trust Rules
- Permissions must be visible (assistant explains denials)
- Destructive actions require confirmation
- All assistant actions appear in Activity Log
